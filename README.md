# Project Outline
The project is under the instruction of Terence Parr as one of the projects of MSAN692 Data Acquisition.


The goal of this project is to learn how to pull twitter data, using the tweepy wrapper around the twitter API, and how to perform simple sentiment analysis using the vaderSentiment library. The tweepy library hides all of the complexity necessary to handshake with Twitter's server for a secure connection.
